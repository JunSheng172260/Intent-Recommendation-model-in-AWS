![GitHub Logo](/flow.png)

Remark:
*All the codes was running in AWS Lambda
*Please specify your own parameter in the code as the parameter in these few files was based on my AWS environment.

To run the system code, please follow the following step:
1. Run InputFile.py
2. Run TriggerComprehend.py
3. Run Fileunzip.py
4. Run IntentRecommendation.py

#For IntentRecommendation.py, we have to create a table of recommendations in dynamo db first in order for the intent to map with recommendations
